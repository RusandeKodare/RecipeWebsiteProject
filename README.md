This project will consist of me coding what I've learned in HTLM.

I have picked 4 recipes that I will be adding to my website. I've made sure to add the original page under the image for the recipe. 
In this project I have practiced making lists, linking images, webpages (both absoulute and relative links) and using tags like &#60;strong&#62; and &#60;p&#62;.
